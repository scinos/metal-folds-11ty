I'm Sergio, a Software Engineer from Spain.

A couple of years ago I discovered a [Metal Earth model](https://www.metalearth.com/) in a gift shop. I bought a cheap
one just to try it out and I was immediately hooked! Since then I've built dozens of model and my collection is
expanding every week.

This page is a collection of the models I've built so far.
