I love this model! It was super fun to build, it looks SPECTACULAR and even has a movable turret!!

It's a premium model from MU, but I can't find it in the website anymore. Given it's a fairly old model (2017 according
to the box), likely they don't sell it anymore. But you can still find it in a few online shops if you are interested.

This model has a few features that I really love. First, the instructions are a 12-page booklet in full color. This is
much better than the crappy black&white photocopy you get with other cheap models. Second, the tabs have a small dent
that make them "click" into place, very useful to make sure they stay in place while connecting other parts of the
piece. The box also included a set of small tools and protection for the fingers, but I haven't found a reason to use
either.

The design is just austonding. I love the vibrant blue color for the body parts and matte black for the wheels. The
pieces have a lot of detail (there is even a tiny shovel!). Once built, it feels quite sturdy. Plus the turret is
movable (it turns 360Â°), how cool is that?
