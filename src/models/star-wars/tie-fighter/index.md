You can't miss this model if you are a Star Wars fan. The iconic TIE Fighter looks pretty cool with the glossy finish
and its huge wings.

The main cockpit (whose official name is the Command Pod, I just googled it) was quite challenging. It's basically a
sphere composed of 8 slices with open ended to attach the cabin viewport and the babck reactor. It took me a few attemps
to connect all tabs, and at the end the cabin was very dented. I had to use the front/back openings to press with a
round peg to shape it back into a spherical shape.

The connection for the wings wasn't very sturdy, and I end up using lots of glue because I was concerned about them
falling out. And still, they are quite flimsy and it fills like they can drop at any moment. The wings had these braces
both in the interior and exterior. They were numbered from 1 to 6 (as you can see in some of the pictures) and while I
don't like those marks being visible in the final model, I do appreciate the numbers to understand which brace goes
where.
