A very fun model to build. I enjoyed building the helmet and the torso. The lightsaber is detachable and has a very cool
glossy red layer.

However, the end result is a bit poor because for some reason my figure is leaning back, which gives him a comical pose.
I'm not sure which piece I got wrong, and I suspect is a combination of many little mistakes here and there.

Getting the legs was quite challenging and I got them wrong and had to rebuild them. It wasn't clear to me which part of
the piece is the exterior. The interior has "engraved stripes that support the bend" (according to the instructions),
and the exterior has decorative engraved stripes. They do look different, but it is hard to know which is which. And I
got it wrong, basically resulting in a left leg that is built as a right leg. I only found the mistake when building the
hips and had to redo the legs. Thankfully nothing broke, but they end up with lots of scratches.

Building the helmet was also somewhat hard, as they have many little pieces and it's not clear from the pictures in the
instructions if they have a concave or convex fold. I think I got all of them right on the first try. At least they look
ok to me.
