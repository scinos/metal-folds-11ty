This model was interesting to build, it has many features I haven't encountered before.

For starters, it has two different heads: the classic C-3PO head (as seen in the images) and a B1 battle droid head (aka
the "Roger roger" droids from the Phantom Menance movie). It is possible to attach and detach them once the model is
built, as long as you don't bend the tabs for the head-neck connection. I didn't bend the tabs for the connection, but I
didn't build the B1 head so I wasn't able to swap them anyway.

Another interesting feature: there are pieces with parts you have to twist 90 or 180 degrees to their final place. For
example, the pistons in the arms. It's a weird technique and I was scared the piece will just break. Fortunately, it
didn't.

Overall I'm not too impressed with this model. It was fun to build an iconic character like C-3PO, but the model itself
is a bit wobbly, and prone to scratches due the gold coloring. Also, I'm pretty sure I got some pieces of the arm mixed
because they end up being bent in a very strange pose, not like the pictures you can see in the official model.
